Text: What's the difference between your typical Honua Kai owner and yours truly? Well, a credit rating would be one thing. And all I really need to enjoy the Big Island are some board shorts and a sunny day. 

But for those whose standard of living is measured by the envy of others, Honua Kai is the ultimate home away from home. An exclusive resort community featuring a world-class spa, 24hour concierge, valet parking and other necessities of life on a private stretch of beachfront considered among the finest in the world.
