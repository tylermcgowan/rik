Text: I confess. I've always been a bit of a street meat junkie.

I’ll happily down a couple of footlongs loaded with nitrates and questionable animal by-products as long as they’re smothered in hot peppers and sauerkraut. The indigestion that inevitably follows is the price one pays for the creative, if not hallucinogenic inspiration they ultimately provide.

So it was a novel experience to be kicking back on the patio while the client grilled up a batch of healthy dogs. Made with 100% pure turkey, they were delicious. 
No condiments required.
And no embarrassing meat sweats after.
